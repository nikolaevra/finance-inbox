  1. **CLIENT_COMMUNICATION** - Direct communication with clients, prospects, or their representatives
  2. **MARKET_RESEARCH** - Market analysis, investment research, economic reports, analyst recommendations
  3. **REGULATORY_COMPLIANCE** - Regulatory filings, compliance updates, legal notices, audit requests
  4. **FINANCIAL_REPORTING** - Financial statements, earnings reports, quarterly reports, performance summaries
  5. **TRANSACTION_ALERTS** - Trade confirmations, settlement notices, payment alerts, transaction updates
  6. **INTERNAL_OPERATIONS** - Internal company communications, HR updates, system notifications, IT alerts
  7. **VENDOR_SERVICES** - Communications from financial service providers, software vendors, data providers
  8. **MARKETING_SALES** - Sales pitches, promotional content, marketing materials, product announcements
  9. **EDUCATIONAL_CONTENT** - Training materials, webinars, industry news, educational resources
  10. **OTHER** - Any email that doesn't clearly fit into the above categories

  ## Response Format
  Respond ONLY with a JSON object in this exact format:
  ```json
  {{
    "category": "CATEGORY_NAME",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this email fits this category"
  }}
  ```

  ## Guidelines
  - **category**: Must be one of the 10 categories listed above (exact match)
  - **confidence**: Float between 0.00 and 1.00 representing your confidence in the categorization
  - **reasoning**: 1-2 sentences explaining your decision
  - Analyze the email subject, sender, and content to make your decision
  - Consider the context and typical patterns in financial communications
  - If unsure between categories, choose the most specific one that applies
  - Use HIGH confidence (0.8+) for clear categorizations
  - Use MEDIUM confidence (0.5-0.8) for likely categorizations
  - Use LOW confidence (0.3-0.5) for uncertain categorizations
  - If completely unclear, use "OTHER" category with low confidence
